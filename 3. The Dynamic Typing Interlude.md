# The Dynamic Typing Interlude

As you can see in Python, we do not declare the specific types of the objects our scripts use. Because dynamic typing is the root of this flexibility, and is also a potential stumbling block for newcomers, let’s take a brief side trip to explore the model here.

## The Case of the Missing Declaration Statements

So far, we’ve been using variables without declaring their existence or their types, and it somehow works. When we type a = 3 in an interactive session or program file, for instance, how does Python know that a should stand for an integer? For that matter, how does Python know what a is at all?  

Once you start asking such questions, you’ve crossed over into the domain of Python’s dynamic typing model. In Python, types are determined automatically at runtime, not in response to declarations in your code. This means that you never declare variables ahead of time.  

### Variables, Objects, and References

As you’ve seen in many of the examples used so far when you run an assignment statement such as a = 3 in Python, it works even if you’ve never told Python to use the name a as a variable, or that a should stand for an integer-type object. In the Python language, this all pans out in a very natural way, as follows:

- **Variable creation**  
A variable (i.e., name), like a, is created when your code first assigns it a value. Future assignments change the value of the already created name. Technically, Python detects some names before your code runs, but you can think of it as though initial assignments make variables.  
- **Variable types**  
A variable never has any type information or constraints associated with it. The notion of type lives with objects, not names. Variables are generic in nature; they always simply refer to a particular object at a particular point in time.  
- **Variable use**  
When a variable appears in an expression, it is immediately replaced with the object that it currently refers to, whatever that may be. Further, all variables must be explicitly assigned before they can be used; referencing unassigned variables results in errors.  

In sum, variables are created when assigned, can reference any type of object, and must be assigned before they are referenced.  

when we say this to assign a variable a value:

```py
a = 3
```
At least conceptually, Python will perform three distinct steps to carry out the request. These steps reflect the operation of all assignments in the Python language:

1. Create an object to represent the value `3`.
2. Create the variable `a`, if it does not yet exist.
3. Link the variable `a` to the new object `3`.

These links from variables to objects are called references in Python—that is, a reference is a kind of association, implemented as a pointer in memory. Whenever the variables are later used (i.e., referenced), Python automatically follows the variable-to-object links. This is all simpler than the terminology may imply. In concrete terms:

- Variables are entries in a system table, with spaces for links to objects.
- Objects are pieces of allocated memory, with enough space to represent the values for which they stand.
- References are automatically followed pointers from variables to objects.  

## Types Live with Objects, Not Variables

To see how object types come into play, watch what happens if we assign a variable multiple times:

```py
a = 3           # It's an integer
a = 'somnesh'   # Now it's a sting
a = 1.23        # Now it's a floating point
```

In this example it appears as though the type of `a` changes from integer to string when we say `a = 'spam'`. However, that’s not really what’s happening. *Names* have no types; as stated earlier, types live with objects, not names.  

In the preceding listing, we’ve simply changed `a` to reference different objects. In fact, all we can ever say about a variable in Python is that it references a particular object at a particular point in time.

Objects, on the other hand, know what type they are—each object contains a header field that tags the object with its type. The integer object 3, for example, will contain the value 3, plus a designator that tells Python that the object is an integer (strictly speaking, a pointer to an object called int, the name of the integer type). The type designator of the 'spam' string object points to the string type (called str) instead. Because objects know their types, variables don’t have to.
