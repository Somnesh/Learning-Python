In Python, numbers are not a single object type, but a category of similer types.
Python supports the usual numeric types (integers and floating points), as well as literals for creating 
numbers and expressions for processing them. In addition, Python provides more advanced numeric programming
support and objects for more advanced work.

A complete inventory of Python's numeric toolbox includes:

• Integer and floating-point objects
• Complex number objects
• Decimal: fixed precision objects
• Fraction: rational number objects
• Sets: collections with numeric operations
• Booleans: true and false
• Build-in functions and modules: round, math, random, etc.
• Expressions; unlimited integer precision; bitwise operations; hex, octal, and binary formats
• Third-party extensions: vectors, libraries, visualization, plotting, etc.
