# String Fundamentals

So far, we’ve studied numbers and explored Python’s dynamic typing model. The next major type on our in-depth core object tour is the Python `string` — an ordered collection of characters used to store and represent text- and bytes-based information.

## String Basics

From a functional perspective, `strings` can be used to represent just about anything that can be encoded as text or bytes. Python `strings` are categorized as *immutable sequences*, meaning that the characters they contain have a left-to-right positional order and that they cannot be changed in place. In fact, `strings` are the first representative of the larger class of objects called `sequences` that we will study here.  

The table below previews common string literals and operations we will discuss in this chapter:  

| Operation | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| S = '' | Empty string |
| S = "spam's" | Double quotes, same as single |
| S = 's\np\ta\x00m' | Escape sequences |
| S = """...multiline...""" | Triple-quoted block strings |
| S = r'\temp\spam' | Raw strings (no escapes) |
| B = b'sp\xc4m' | Byte strings in 2.6, 2.7, and 3.X |
| U = u'sp\u00c4m' | Unicode strings in 2.X and 3.3+ |
| S1 + S2 | Concatenate, repeat |
| S * 3 <br> S[i] <br> S[i:j] <br> len(S) | Index, slice, length |
| "a %s parrot" % kind | String formatting expression |
| "a {0} parrot".format(kind) | String formatting method in 2.6, 2.7, and 3.X |
| S.find('pa') | String methods : search, |
| S.rstrip() | remove whitespace, |
| S.replace('pa', 'xx') | replacement, |
| S.split(',') | split on delimiter, |
