# String Fundamentals

So far, we’ve studied numbers and explored Python’s dynamic typing model. The next major type on our in-depth core object tour is the Python `string` — an ordered collection of characters used to store and represent text- and bytes-based information.

## String Basics

From a functional perspective, `strings` can be used to represent just about anything that can be encoded as text or bytes. Python `strings` are categorized as *immutable sequences*, meaning that the characters they contain have a left-to-right positional order and that they cannot be changed in place. In fact, `strings` are the first representative of the larger class of objects called `sequences` that we will study here.  

The table below previews common string literals and operations we will discuss in this chapter:  

| Operation | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| `S = ''` | Empty string |
| `S = "spam's"` | Double quotes, same as single |
| `S = 's\np\ta\x00m'` | Escape sequences |
| `S = """...multiline..."""` | Triple-quoted block strings |
| `S = r'\temp\spam'` | Raw strings (no escapes) |
| `B = b'sp\xc4m'` | Byte strings in 2.6, 2.7, and 3.X |
| `U = u'sp\u00c4m'` | Unicode strings in 2.X and 3.3+ |
| `S1 + S2` <br> `S * 3` | Concatenate, repeat |
| `S[i]` <br> `S[i:j]` <br> `len(S)` | Index, slice, length |
| `"a %s parrot" % kind` | String formatting expression |
| `"a {0} parrot".format(kind)` | String formatting method in 2.6, 2.7, and 3.X |
| `S.find('pa')` | String methods : search, |
| `S.rstrip()` | remove whitespace, |
| `S.replace('pa', 'xx')` | replacement, |
| `S.split(',')` | split on delimiter, |  
| `S.isdigit()` | content test, |
| `S.lower()` | case conversion, |
| `S.endswith('spam')` | end test, |
| `'spam'.join(strlist)` | delimiter join, |
| `S.encode('latin-1')` | Unicode encoding, |
| `B.decode('utf8')` | Unicode decoding, etc. |
| `for x in S: print(x)` <br> `'spam' in S` <br> `[c * 2 for c in S]` <br> `map(ord, S)` | Iteration, membership |
| `re.match('sp(.*)am', line)` | Pattern matching: library module |

Beyond the core set of string tools in the above Table, Python also supports more advanced pattern-based string processing with the standard library’s `re` (for “regular expression”) module, and even higher-level text processing tools such as XML parsers.

## String Literals

By and large, strings are fairly easy to use in Python. Perhaps the most complicated thing about them is that there are so many ways to write them in your code:  

- Single quotes: `'spa"m'`
- Double quotes: `"spa'm"`
- Triple quotes: `'''... spam ...'''`, `"""... spam ..."""`
- Escape sequences: `"s\tp\na\0m"`
- Raw strings: `r"C:\new\test.spm"`
- Bytes literals: `b'sp\x01am'`
- Unicode literals: `u'eggs\u0020spam'`
