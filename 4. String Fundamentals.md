# String Fundamentals

So far, we’ve studied numbers and explored Python’s dynamic typing model. The next major type on our in-depth core object tour is the Python `string` — an ordered collection of characters used to store and represent text- and bytes-based information.

## String Basics

From a functional perspective, `strings` can be used to represent just about anything that can be encoded as text or bytes. Python `strings` are categorized as *immutable sequences*, meaning that the characters they contain have a left-to-right positional order and that they cannot be changed in place. In fact, `strings` are the first representative of the larger class of objects called `sequences` that we will study here.  

The table below previews common string literals and operations we will discuss in this chapter:  

| Operation | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| `S = ''` | Empty string |
| `S = "spam's"` | Double quotes, same as single |
| `S = 's\np\ta\x00m'` | Escape sequences |
| `S = """...multiline..."""` | Triple-quoted block strings |
| `S = r'\temp\spam'` | Raw strings (no escapes) |
| `B = b'sp\xc4m'` | Byte strings in 2.6, 2.7, and 3.X |
| `U = u'sp\u00c4m'` | Unicode strings in 2.X and 3.3+ |
| `S1 + S2` <br> `S * 3` | Concatenate, repeat |
| `S[i]` <br> `S[i:j]` <br> `len(S)` | Index, slice, length |
| `"a %s parrot" % kind` | String formatting expression |
| `"a {0} parrot".format(kind)` | String formatting method in 2.6, 2.7, and 3.X |
| `S.find('pa')` | String methods : search, |
| `S.rstrip()` | remove whitespace, |
| `S.replace('pa', 'xx')` | replacement, |
| `S.split(',')` | split on delimiter, |  
| `S.isdigit()` | content test, |
| `S.lower()` | case conversion, |
| `S.endswith('spam')` | end test, |
| `'spam'.join(strlist)` | delimiter join, |
| `S.encode('latin-1')` | Unicode encoding, |
| `B.decode('utf8')` | Unicode decoding, etc. |
| `for x in S: print(x)` <br> `'spam' in S` <br> `[c * 2 for c in S]` <br> `map(ord, S)` | Iteration, membership |
| `re.match('sp(.*)am', line)` | Pattern matching: library module |

Beyond the core set of string tools in the above Table, Python also supports more advanced pattern-based string processing with the standard library’s `re` (for “regular expression”) module, and even higher-level text processing tools such as XML parsers.

## String Literals

By and large, strings are fairly easy to use in Python. Perhaps the most complicated thing about them is that there are so many ways to write them in your code:  

- Single quotes: `'spa"m'`
- Double quotes: `"spa'm"`
- Triple quotes: `'''... spam ...'''`, `"""... spam ..."""`
- Escape sequences: `"s\tp\na\0m"`
- Raw strings: `r"C:\new\test.spm"`
- Bytes literals: `b'sp\x01am'`
- Unicode literals: `u'eggs\u0020spam'`

> ### Single- and Double-Quoted Strings Are the Same
>
>The reason for supporting both is that it allows you to embed a quote character of the other variety inside a string without escaping it with a backslash. You may embed a single-quote character in a string enclosed in double-quote characters, and vice versa:
>```py
>print('knight"s', "knight's")
># Output: ('knight"s', "knight's")
>```

## Escape Sequences

| Escape | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `\newline` | Ignored (continuation line) |
| `\\` | Backslash (stores one \) |
| `\'` | Single quote (stores ') |
| `\"` | Double quote (stores ") |
| `\a` | Bell |
| `\b` | Backspace |
| `\f` | Formfeed |
| `\n` | Newline (linefeed) |
| `\r` | Carriage return |
| `\t` | Horizontal tab |
| `\v` | Vertical tab |
| `\xhh` | Character with hex value hh (exactly 2 digits) |
| `\ooo` | Character with octal value ooo (up to 3 digits) |
| `\0` | Null: binary 0 character (doesn’t end string) |
| `\N{ id }` | Unicode database ID |
| `\uhhhh` | Unicode character with 16-bit hex value |
| `\Uhhhhhhhh` | Unicode character with 32-bit hex valuea |
| `\other` | Not an escape (keeps both \ and other) |  

## Raw Strings Suppress Escapes

As we’ve seen, escape sequences are handy for embedding special character codes within strings. Sometimes, though, the special treatment of backslashes for introducing escapes can lead to trouble. For instance, to see consider the following:

```py
myfile = open('C:\new\text.dat','w')
```
thinking that they will open a file called *text.dat* in the directory *C:\new*. The problem
here is that `\n` is taken to stand for a newline character, and `\t` is replaced with a tab. In effect, the call tries to open a file named *C:(newline)ew(tab)ext.dat*.  

This is just the sort of thing that raw strings are useful for. If the letter `r` (uppercase or lowercase) appears just before the opening quote of a string, it turns off the escape mechanism. Therefore, to fix the filename problem:

```py
myfile = open(r'C:\new\text.dat', 'w')
```  

Alternatively, because two backslashes are really an escape sequence for one backslash, you can keep your backslashes by simply doubling them up:

```py
myfile = open('C:\\new\\text.dat', 'w')
```

## Triple Quotes Code Multiline Block Strings

Python also has a triple-quoted string literal format, sometimes called a *block string*, that is a syntactic convenience for coding multiline text data. This form begins with three quotes (of either the single or double variety), is followed by any number of lines of text, and is closed with the same triple-quote sequence that opened it.

```py
str = '''Hi
my name is Somnesh Mukhopadhyay
I'm a student
'''
print(str)
```

## Stings in Action

This section and the next two demonstrate string expressions, methods, and formatting—the first line of text-processing tools in the Python language.

### Indexing and Slicing

Indexing (`S[i]`) fetches components at offsets:
- The first item is at offset `0`.
- Negative indexes mean to count backward from the end or right.
- `S[0]` fetches the first item.
- `S[−2]` fetches the second item from the end (like `S[len(S)−2]`).

Slicing (`S[i:j]`) extracts contiguous sections of sequences:
- The upper bound is noninclusive.
- Slice boundaries default to `0` and the sequence length, if omitted.
- `S[1:3]` fetches items at offsets `1` up to but not including `3`.
- `S[1:]` fetches items at offset `1` through the end (the sequence length).
- `S[:3]` fetches items at offset `0` up to but not including `3`.
- `S[:−1]` fetches items at offset `0` up to but not including the last item.
- `S[:]` fetches items at offsets `0` through the end—making a top-level copy of `S`.

Extended slicing (`S[i:j:k]`) accepts a step (or stride) k, which defaults to `+1`:
- Allows for skipping items and reversing order—see the next section.

#### Extended slicing: The third limit and slice objects

Slice expressions have support for an optional third index, used as a step (sometimes called a *stride*). The step is added to the index of each item extracted. The full-blown form of a slice is now `X[I:J:K]`, which means “extract all the items in `X`, from offset `I` through `J−1`, by `K`.” The third limit, `K`, defaults to `+1`, which is why normally all items in a slice are extracted from left to right.

```py
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(a[2:4:2]) # Output: [3]
print(a[::-1]) # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

### String Conversion Tools

The `int()` function converts a string to a number, and the `str()` function converts a number to its string representation. The `repr()` function also converts an object to its string representation, but returns the object as a string of code that can be rerun to recreate the object. 

```py
print(str('spam'), repr('spam'))

# Output: spam 'spam'
```

#### Character code conversions

On the subject of conversions, it is also possible to convert a single character to its underlying integer code (e.g., its ASCII byte value) by passing it to the built-in `ord()` function — this returns the actual binary value used to represent the corresponding character in memory. The `chr()` function performs the inverse operation, taking an integer code and converting it to the corresponding character:

```py
print(ord(s)) # Output: 115
print(chr(115)) # Output: s
```

### String Methods
methods are simply functions that are associated with and act upon particular objects. Technically, they are attributes attached to objects that happen to reference callable functions which always have an implied subject. In finer-grained detail, functions are packages of code, and method calls combine two operations at once — an attribute fetch and a call:  

#### Attribute fetches
An expression of the form *`object.attribute`* means “fetch the value of *`attribute`* in *`object`*.”  
#### Call expressions
An expression of the form *`function(arguments)`* means “invoke the code of *`function`*, passing zero or more comma-separated *`argument`* objects to it, and return *`function`*’s result value.”  

Putting these two together allows us to call a method of an object. The method call expression:  
  
*`object.method(arguments)`*  

is evaluated from left to right — Python will first fetch the *`method`* of the *`object`* and then call it, passing in both *`object`* and the *`arguments`*. Or, in plain words, the method call expression means this:  
  
Call *`method`* to process *`object`* with *`arguments`*

#### String Method Examples: Changing Strings

Because strings are immutable, they cannot be changed in place directly. But, if you’re really just out to replace a substring, you can use the string `replace` method:  

```py
s = 'coow'
s = s.replace('co','w')

print(s) # Output: wow
```  

The replace method is more general than this code implies. It takes as arguments the original substring (of any length) and the string (of any length) to replace it with, and performs a global search and replace.
  
On the other hand, the `find` method returns the offset where the substring appears (by default, searching from the front), or ***−1*** if it is not found.

```py
s = 'Somnesh'

print(s.find('es')) # Output: 4
```
  
we can use the `replace` method with a third argument to limit it to a single substitution:
  
```py
s = 'xxxxGGxxxxGGxxxx'

# Replace one
print(s.replace('GG','OP', 1)) # Output: xxxxOPxxxxGGxxxx
```
  
The fact that concatenation operations and the replace method generate new string objects each time they are run is actually a potential downside of using them to change strings. If you have to apply many changes to a very large string, you might be able to improve your script’s performance by converting the string to an object that does support in-place changes:
  
```py
s = 'somxxsh'
L = list(s)

print(L) # Output: ['s', 'o', 'm', 'x', 'x', 's', 'h']

L[3] = 'n'
L[4] = 'e'

```
  
If, after your changes, you need to convert back to a string (e.g., to write to a file), use the string join method to *“implode”* the list back into a string:
  
```py
s = ''.join(L)

print(s) # Output: somnesh
```
  
The join method may look a bit backward at first sight. Because it is a method of strings (not of lists), it is called through the desired delimiter. join puts the strings in a list (or other iterable) together, with the delimiter between list items; in this case, it uses an empty string delimiter to convert from a list back to a string. More generally, any string delimiter and iterable of strings will do:
  
```py
print('GG'.join(['hi','hello','bye'])) # Output: hiGGhelloGGbye
```
In fact, joining substrings all at once might often run faster than concatenating them individually.
