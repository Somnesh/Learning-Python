# Numeric Types

In Python, numbers are not a single object type, but a category of similer types.
Python supports the usual numeric types (integers and floating points), as well as literals for creating 
numbers and expressions for processing them. In addition, Python provides more advanced numeric programming
support and objects for more advanced work.

**A complete inventory of Python's numeric toolbox includes:**

- Integer and floating-point objects
- Complex number objects
- Decimal: fixed precision objects
- Fraction: rational number objects
- Sets: collections with numeric operations
- Booleans: true and false
- Build-in functions and modules: round, math, random, etc.
- Expressions; unlimited integer precision; bitwise operations; hex, octal, and binary formats
- Third-party extensions: vectors, libraries, visualization, plotting, etc.

## Numeric Literals

| Literals | interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| 1234, -24, 0, 99999999999999 | Integers (unlimited size) |
| 1.23, 1., 3.14e-10, 4E210, 4.0e+210 | Floating-point numbers |
| 0o177, 0x9ff, 0b101010 | Octal, hex, and binary literals |
| 3+4j, 3.0+4.0j, 3J | Complex number literals |
| set('spam'), {1, 2, 3, 4} | Sets: construction forms |
| Decimal('1.0'), Fraction(1, 3) | Decimal and fraction extension types |
| bool(X), True, False | Boolean type and constants |

> ### Complex numbers
>
> Python complex literals are written as ***realpart+imaginarypart***, where the imaginarypart is terminated with a **j** or **J**. The ***realpart*** is technically optional, so the ***imaginarypart*** may appear on its own.Internally, complex numbers are implemented as pairs of floating-point numbers, but all numeric operations perform complex math when applied to complex numbers. 
>
> Complex numbers may also be created with the ***complex(real, imag)*** built-in call.

## Build-in Numeric Tools

#### Python provides a set of tools for processing number objects:

*Expression operators*: ***+, -, *, /, >>, **, &, etc.***

*Build-in mathematical functions*: ***pow, abs, round, int, hex, bin, etc.***

*Utility modules*: ***random, math, etc.***


## Python expression operators and precedence

| Operators | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| yield x | Generator function send protocol |
| lambda args: expression | Anonymous function generation |
| x if y else z | Ternary selection (x is evaluated only if y is true) |
| x or y | Logical OR (y is evaluated only if x is false) |
| x and y | Logical AND (y is evaluated only if x is true) |
| not x | Logical negation |
| x in y, x not in y | Membership (iterables, sets) |
| x is y, x is not y | Object identity tests |
| x < y, x <= y, x > y, x >= y | Magnitude comparison, set subset and superset; |
| x == y, x != y | Value equality operators |
| x | y | Bitwise OR, set union |
| x ^ y | Bitwise XOR, set symmetric difference |
| x & y | Bitwise AND, set intersection |
| x << y, x >> y | Shift x left or right by y bits |
| x + y | Addition, concatenation; |
| x – y | Subtraction, set difference |
| x * y | Multiplication, repetition; |
| x % y | Remainder, format; |
| x / y, x // y | Division: true and floor |
| −x, +x | Negation, identity |
| ˜x | Bitwise NOT (inversion) |
| x ** y | Power (exponentiation) |
| x[i] | Indexing (sequence, mapping, others) |
| x[i:j:k] | Slicing |
| x(...) | Call (function, method, class, other callable) |
| x.attr | Attribute reference |
| (...) | Tuple, expression, generator expression |
| [...] | List, list comprehension |
| {...} | Dictionary, set, set and dictionary comprehensions |


> Operators lower in the table have higher precedence, and so blind more tighly in mixed expression.
>
> Operators in the same row in the table generally group from left to right when combined (except for exponentiation, which groups right to left, and comparisons, which chain left to right).


### Mixed operators follow operator precedence

When you write an expression with more than one operator, Python groups it's parts according to what are called *Precedence rules*, and this grouping determines the order in which the expression's parts are computed.

## Comparisons 

Python allows us to *chain* mutiple comparisons together to perform range tests. Chained comparisons are a sort of shorthand for boolean expressions.

> For instance, the expression **(A < B < C)** tests whether **B** is between **A** and **C**. It's equivalent to the boolean test **(A < B and B < C)**.


```python
X = 2
Y = 4
Z = 6

print(X < Y < Z) #Output: True
```
