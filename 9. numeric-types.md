# Numeric Types

In Python, numbers are not a single object type, but a category of similer types.
Python supports the usual numeric types (integers and floating points), as well as literals for creating 
numbers and expressions for processing them. In addition, Python provides more advanced numeric programming
support and objects for more advanced work.

**A complete inventory of Python's numeric toolbox includes:**

- Integer and floating-point objects
- Complex number objects
- Decimal: fixed precision objects
- Fraction: rational number objects
- Sets: collections with numeric operations
- Booleans: true and false
- Build-in functions and modules: round, math, random, etc.
- Expressions; unlimited integer precision; bitwise operations; hex, octal, and binary formats
- Third-party extensions: vectors, libraries, visualization, plotting, etc.

## Numeric Literals

| Literals | interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| 1234, -24, 0, 99999999999999 | Integers (unlimited size) |
| 1.23, 1., 3.14e-10, 4E210, 4.0e+210 | Floating-point numbers |
| 0o177, 0x9ff, 0b101010 | Octal, hex, and binary literals |
| 3+4j, 3.0+4.0j, 3J | Complex number literals |
| set('spam'), {1, 2, 3, 4} | Sets: construction forms |
| Decimal('1.0'), Fraction(1, 3) | Decimal and fraction extension types |
| bool(X), True, False | Boolean type and constants |

> ### Complex numbers
>
> Python complex literals are written as ***realpart+imaginarypart***, where the imaginarypart is terminated with a **j** or **J**. The ***realpart*** is technically optional, so the ***imaginarypart*** may appear on its own.Internally, complex numbers are implemented as pairs of floating-point numbers, but all numeric operations perform complex math when applied to complex numbers. 
>
> Complex numbers may also be created with the ***complex(real, imag)*** built-in call.

## Build-in Numeric Tools

#### Python provides a set of tools for processing number objects:

*Expression operators*: __+, -, *, /, >>, **, &, etc.__

*Build-in mathematical functions*: ***pow, abs, round, int, hex, bin, etc.***

*Utility modules*: ***random, math, etc.***
