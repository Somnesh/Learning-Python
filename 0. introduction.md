# Introduction to Python

Python is a general-purpose programming language that is often applied in scripting roles. It is commonly
defined as an ***object-oriented scripting language*** - a definition that blends support for OOP with an overall
orientation toward scripting roles. 

Python is probably better known as a ***general-perpose programming language*** that blends procedural functional, and object-oriented paradigms - a statement that captures the richness and scope of today's Python.
